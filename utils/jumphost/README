Run the install.sh script to create a symbolic link in ~/.ssh/getdb which points
to the getdb file in this directory (then you will always have the latest changes
when you pull this repository, that is, you won't have to repeat these steps).

Then add the following lines to the ~/.ssh/config file (without the dashed lines):
--------------------
Host */jh
    ProxyCommand ~/.ssh/getdb $(dirname %h)

Host jh/*
    ProxyCommand ~/.ssh/getdb $(basename %h)
--------------------

Now you will be able to setup a jumphost to e.g. a server using
following command:
  ssh <a_specified_name>/db
  # OR
  ssh db/<a_specified_name>

Check getdb file for valid values
